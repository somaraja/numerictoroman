### Numeric to Roman number conversion

- Numeric to roman number conversion has been implemented in this project using Java 8 and Intellij IDEA.
- Followed TDD approach by writing test cases first and incrementally added main code in the source files.
- Two source files were written for the same above usecase one with LinkedHashMap and other one using TreeMap, purpose is same but just different approaches.
- 2 Test classes have been created and tried writing test cases from simple to complex using junit. Test cases are same in both the classes but test against 2 different source files.
- All test cases are passing (if we import this project in IDE just need to right click on folder under src/test).
